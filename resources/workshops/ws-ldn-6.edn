 :desc     [:div
            "Whereas the previous workshop is focused on performance intensive applications primarily in the browser, this session is for those interested in using Clojure with modern, native high-performance frameworks to create standalone desktop applications, e.g. graphics intense, interactive data visualizations, machine learning, academic research tools, games, incl. learn how to build and manipulate these dynamically from the REPL. We will enter territory still unexplored by most professional Clojurians and get a glimpse, how with the help of OpenGL4 & OpenCL, we can truly make the most of Clojure and enable it for more use cases."
