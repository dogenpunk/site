            "Clojure & ClojureScript from 0 to 100 - This workshop will provide you with a strong foundation in both languages in a variety of typical usage contexts: from basic data processing examples, exploring functional programming concepts, data analysis, data modeling, to simple web application development (both in the browser and server-side) and small interactive and visual experiments, all utilizing and demonstrating the power and flexibility of Clojure's language features and interactive workflows. Participants should have general programming knowledge, but " [:strong "no prior Clojure knowledge is required."]
