            "3D printing technology is becoming ever more affordable and there's no shortage of design tools. However, this workshop is for anyone interested in using an algorithmic approach to fabricate physical objects and do so using a language & toolset, which makes playing with data and geometry truly joyful. Over the two days of this workshop, you'll will learn hands-on some of the endless potential, which procedural generation can bring to the field of digital fabrication. And, you'll not only be able to take home your own 3D printed object, but too learn about important skills and pitfalls to watch out for in your future practice with these technologies."
